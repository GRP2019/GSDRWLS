===
This is a Pytorch implementation of our 2020 work:
* Deep Group-Shuffling Dual Random Walks with Label Smoothing for Person Re-Identification 

Our code is mainly based on https://github.com/YantaoShen/kpm_rw_person_reid

Requirements
---
* Download the project from https://github.com/YantaoShen/kpm_rw_person_reid
* Configure enviroment according to its suggestion
* Replace main.py with our file main_GSDRWLS.py
* Replace trainers.py with our file trainers_GSDRWLS.py
* Replace embedding.py with our file embedding_GSDRWLS.py
* Replace evaluators.py with our file evaluators_GSDRWLS.py
* Replace multi_branch.py with our file multi_branch_GSDRWLS.py
* Finally code can be implemented.
